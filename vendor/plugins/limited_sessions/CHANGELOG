* 2010-jul-20 - IPv6, replay attack mitigation, more non-AR support

  - IPv6 now works for subnet matching.
  - New options to configure the allowed subnet size (both IPv4 and 
    IPv6) added.
  - Plugin now enhances reset_session to clear old session data from
    the DB; this prevents session_id replay attacks when using 
    DB-backed session storage.
  - Session activity and hard limits now work with non-ActiveRecord
    session stores. Configuration is done differently depending on 
    which session store is in use.

* 2009-apr-22 - update to support rails 2.3

  - Rails 2.3 changed the internal session code substantially. This new
    version now supports rails 2.3. Note that is no longer supports any
    version of rails prior to 2.3 -- see the README for where to find
    an older version of this plugin for rails 2.2 and earlier. 
  - CONFIGURATION OPTIONS HAVE CHANGED. This is required by the new
    support for rails 2.3. See the README for more information.

* 2008-jul-23 - update to improve rails 2.1 compatibility 
  
  - disable partial-updates for the session table
    (thanks to eilonon erkki for bringing the problem to my attention)
  
* 2007-sep-06 - initial release
